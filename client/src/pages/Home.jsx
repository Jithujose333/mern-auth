      This user authentication app provides a seamless experience for managing user profiles,
       including updating details, changing profile pictures, signing out, and account deletion.
        It utilizes React and Redux Toolkit for state management, ensuring efficient updates and
         persistence. The app enables secure profile updates with real-time feedback and image preview 
         functionality. While the sign-out action executes successfully, refining state updates to
          reflect changes immediately in the UI would improve usability. Overall, the app is well-structured,
           offering essential authentication features with a user-friendly interface.
